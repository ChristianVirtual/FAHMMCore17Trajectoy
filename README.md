FAHMMCore17Trajectoy
====================

Get a working topology of a Core 17 protein to be visualized with iPad app FAHMM

This little script is only a bridge between the mobile monitoring tool running on iPad (and Android); 
it is not visualize by itself (maybe that would be also a nice idea).

Tested on Linux environment with nVidia GPU card and project 13000 and 13001.

Once the iPad app is throught the Review with Apple please give it a shot.


Update 2015/12/25

This one will not be continued.
