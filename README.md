FAHMMCore17Trajectoy
====================

Get a working topology of a Core 17 protein to be visualized with iPad app FAHMM


This little script is only a bridge between the mobile monitoring tool running on iPad (and Android); it is not visualize by itself (maybe that would be also a nice idea).

It is tested on Linux environment with nVidia GPU card and project 13000 and 13001.
